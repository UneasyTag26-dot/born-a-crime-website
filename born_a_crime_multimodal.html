            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In South Africa during Apartheid, the color of one’s skin determined far more than one’s appearance; it was the law. It dictated the path a person could follow, placing them into their respective role in society and determining the job they could work, where they lived, and even with whom they could be friends. Trevor Noah experienced the shackles of Apartheid firsthand, as a mixed boy growing up in the township of Soweto. He did not fit neatly into the system with two clearly defined sides. His very existence challenged the rigid categories of race that apartheid law enforced. In <em>Born a Crime</em>, Trevor Noah reveals how apartheid’s racial hierarchy shaped not only South Africa’s laws but also the psychology of its people. Through his story, Noah exposes how systemic racism can outlast segregation itself, living on through cultural conditioning, economic inequality, and the lasting patterns of injustice that continue to shape societies around the world.

                        Apartheid in South Africa did more than segment people by law; it created a culture of race so persuasive that it determined how people thought about themselves and others. In <em>Born a Crime</em>, Trevor Noah describes how his mere existence was against the law: “To be with my father, who was white, was illegal. We couldn’t be seen together” (Noah&nbsp;21). His childhood was an act of disguise—his mother walking down the other side of the street, his grandfather calling him “Master” in case the neighbors noticed them. These unnecessary acts of security show how apartheid forced families to adopt the logic of the racial hierarchy into their private lives, forcing children as well as adults to navigate the world in camouflage and fear. In his 60 Minutes interview, Noah remembers, “Being with your father, who was white, that was a crime… the law prohibited anyone of different colors from mingling.” The fear of his grandmother that the police would “come and find” him highlights how racism was not merely a political system but a psychological one as well, where survival depended on conformity even if that meant conforming to unjust rules. Both the interview and the book demonstrate that apartheid’s racial order occupied the mind—it taught people to police their own thoughts, relationships, emotions, and self-worth to abide by the fallacious idea that races are unequal. Through this, Noah discloses how racial inequality endures after segregation has been dismantled, existing on through the internalized attitudes and behaviors that originally contributed to its institution.

                        Both Trevor Noah in <em>Born a Crime</em> and Ocean Vuong in “Surrendering” reveal how inequality renews identity, forcing people to find belonging in worlds that remind them they don’t fit in. In <em>Born a Crime</em>, Noah reflects and states, “all I wanted to do was belong… I was brought up in a country where I was taught that your belonging depended on the color of your skin.” His longing to belong identifies with Vuong’s search for the voice and shelter in a society which appears to use the language of Vuong’s culture as a barrier rather than a bridge. Vuong states, “Every word was an inheritance. Every syllable a breath that came before us,” showing the way that language, similar to race, has the power to determine who is heard and who is silenced. Both Noah and Vuong illustrate how identity is survival amidst oppression. Noah’s jokes and Vuong’s poems transform struggle into power, showing how one’s self‑expression can be used as resistance. Together, their stories prove that belonging isn’t given by society but created in the process of defining yourself.

            <h2>Objects of Resistance and Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                Trevor Noah demonstrates how the long‑lasting legacy of apartheid’s rule of racial ordering punctures the order of everyday life through the use of symbols in <em>Born a Crime</em>. His birth certificate is representative of the irrationality of a system that made his life a crime, illustrating how one’s race determined their legality and value from the moment of birth. His school uniform represents the illusion of equality through education because even the education system remained segregated, in turn keeping opportunities racially segregated despite seeming to be united. The church and the cross are religious symbols for faith and racial division. Noah describes the different churches he would attend as “white church” or “black church”, demonstrating how religion also replicated the segregation of South African society. His mother’s car is a symbol of freedom and resistance because Patricia Noah resists racial barriers by driving into locales that, as a black woman, she was not meant to enter. Finally, Trevor Noah’s CDs show how resourcefulness and creativity can be used as means to fight against the system that is meant to limit societal opportunities for those who are deemed less. Noah uses the CDs as a way to create his own opportunities in a society that keeps them from him. Together, these products show how apartheid steered the laws of South Africa and the psychology of its people.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Through humor, resilience, and storytelling, Trevor Noah exposes how apartheid’s legacy still shapes identity and belonging today. His journey reminds us that justice begins when we refuse to accept division as destiny. By listening to stories like those of Noah and Vuong, we can better understand the lasting impact of systemic racism and appreciate the power of art to reclaim self‑definition and forge belonging.
